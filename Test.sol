//The SPDX-License-Identifier comment is used to specify the license under which the smart contract is released. 
//It's a way to communicate the licensing information of the contract and make it easily accessible for developers and users.

//When you include the SPDX-License-Identifier comment in your Solidity smart contract, it serves as a clear indication of the license terms under which the contract's code is published. 
//This is particularly important for open-source projects as it helps others understand the permissions and restrictions related to the contract's usage, distribution, and modification.

//The license specified is "MIT." The MIT license is a permissive open-source license that allows users to use, modify, and distribute the code while providing only minimal restrictions. 
//It's one of the most commonly used open-source licenses in the software development community.

//Including the SPDX-License-Identifier comment is considered a best practice, especially for public repositories and contracts, as it helps ensure compliance with licensing requirements and makes it easier for others to use your code responsibly.

//A smart contract in the context of Ethereum and Solidity is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. 
//It resides on the Ethereum blockchain and can perform actions when specific conditions are met.
